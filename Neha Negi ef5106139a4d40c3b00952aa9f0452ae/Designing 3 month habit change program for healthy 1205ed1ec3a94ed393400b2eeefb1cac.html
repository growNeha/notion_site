A hardcopy is preferred so Neha can have a physical access to the material and can keep it around her workplace or bedside table to read. We want her to be very thorough of this mindset of behaviour change.
In case we are going for a kit, it can also include a merchandise small sized spoon, bowl and plate by XYZ. The spoon will be used as an intervention for mindfully consuming desserts or her late night cravings. The bowl and plate is to have portion control incorporated in her routine.

- what triggered her weak moment
- what are her thoughts and feelings

Eg someone posted how they went on a social dinner with family and how they managed to still eat in small portions, while savouring every moment of that meal. This will act as a motivation to other readers when they are in a similar situation - relatedness under SDT.</p></div></details><details open=""><summary style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.25em;line-height:1.3;margin:0">Month #3. - Running in the wild, all by yourself</summary><div class="indented"><p id="6d566c4c-e881-43d8-9f85-81e2a78ed62a" class="">

This journaling activity done after 2 months of skill practicing will help her self reflect the new lifestyle and what effect it has on her overall physical and mental health.</li></ul><p id="b1eaf9c4-32b9-4b80-abed-17f3b8df7935" class=""><strong>Coach’s job</strong> : Help Neha in habit of setting higher goals, when previous are achieved. Setting higher goals have helps sustaining weight after hitting a plateau. eg going for jujitsu training, practising handstands, leading community walks or guiding other people from their experience. It can depend person to person and the session towards the later half of 3rd month will be devoted to help her set higher goals for herself. </p><ul id="c27dbe52-5893-4f2b-abbc-806c2553cab4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Towards the end of 3rd month, a peer buddy will be assigned to Neha from previous batch’s whatsapp group (those who have completed the training and have volunteered to be buddies). 
This works in 2 ways -
1) The assigned buddy now has a higher goal set - to help someone like her. Research has shown that setting higher goals such as leading other communities with changes, have lead to sustain healthy habits after hitting a plateau. 
2) Neha has a support buddy to help her in times when she has failed for some reason and needs a coping mechanism. Seeking support from social groups aligned towards the same goals, has helped people cope with failure and avoid falling back to old patterns again. </li></ul><ul id="c146147e-c085-494a-89aa-73f235e93581" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">There will be a video session of all the peer groups towards the end of 3rd month. This session is done to end the course on a positive note, where everyone discusses the changes they’ve experienced and how it has impacted their lives.
This works in 2 ways :
1) Setting a positive ending tone of the program, so that people remember XYZ as a positive experience. 
2) A virtual meeting of all peers will let them bond over common struggle in a more engaging manner. Since the program will end here, Neha can chose to stay in touch with her peers and organise real health meets together or even participate in marathons together ! Emotions are contagious and emotions of achievement and progress can be utilised in a way to further catalyse goal setting in peer groups.  </li></ul><figure class="block-color-gray_background callout" style="white-space:pre-wrap;display:flex" id="36d1f6a1-cfb1-49fd-a6b1-866afad97468"><div style="font-size:1.5em"><span class="icon">💡</span></div><div style="width:100%">The peak-end rule by Daniel is a cognitive bias that suggests people primarily remember and evaluate experiences based on the peak (the most intense or emotionally charged moment) and the end of the experience, rather than considering the experience as a whole. This bias can influence our perceptions and memories of various events, including emotional experiences, pain, or even the overall satisfaction of an experience.</div></figure><ul id="7b14a9ab-7ce7-4dd1-a5c6-239d04765a11" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">At the end of program, Neha will receive a report of her overall journey and progress through the program. Using her personal insights we will give her a well displayed information graph of all the learnings she achieved so far. Her triggers, how she managed them, which strategies worked best and her overall progress throughout. It will be like a report card to motivate and praise her efforts and also as a cheat sheet for her to refer after this course. Having a concrete report card in hand along with subjective changes in feelings and physical changes in weight, will keep her motivated to continue on the journey of healthy living.</li></ul></div></details><p id="f87454b1-230c-44eb-a8b6-e909aac1e776" class="">
